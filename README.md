# Player animation test

Fabric mod using playerAnimator by KosmX to do a gum gum pistol animation.

Unfortunately, it's documentation is basically non-existent, taking me nearly 3 days to figure out how to get it working in 1.21.1 (without mixins, like the example)

Still haven't gotten bendylib to work, but this project kind of just serves as a barebones example for how to get playerAnimator to work without mixins on 1.21+
